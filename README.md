Simple tool to discover the function, its degree and the distance between two points on a plane based on their coordinates. I just had nothing better to do and wrote this lazy code.

## Usage

Install Sympy if you don't have it already:
```
pip install sympy
```

Open the terminal on the directory the `1eq_calc.py` file is. You can also use:
```
cd /the/path/you/put/the/file
```

Then execute it:
```
python3 1eq_calc.py
```
